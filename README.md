# Desciption

This is a 2D top down swordfighting and gunplay game. Think Legend of Zelda and Hyperlight drifter.
It was written in Java using Swing, so everything other than the graphics was written from scratch. 95% of assets are my own.

Features include sword swinging, multi-dashing, acceleration based movement, 2 guns you can toggle between, unified ammo system, knockback, collision detection, sliding, wall-bouncing, a photo gallery, instructions page, menu with animations, the list goes on.
This was my first big project (and my biggest to date). 

Warning:

The code is structured well, but unoptimized, and not well written. I tried revamping the code, but I haven't finished, so this is just my development repo. It's a really big project, so re-vamping it has taken a VERY long time and I don't know if I will ever finish.
