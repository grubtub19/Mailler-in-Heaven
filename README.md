## Desciption

Mailler in Heaven is a top-down 2D action game where you play as Dr. Roger Mailler who takes on hoards of innocent demon horses using swords and guns. 

The game was developed in Java using the Swing graphics engine. The game engine and gameplay were written from scratch and 90% of assets are my own.

## Features

* Momentum-based movement
* Multi-dash chaining
* Sliding (actionable and unactionable)
* Collision detection including momentum-conserving wall bounces
* Knockback/Staggering
* Swordplay
* Shotgun and piercing sniper rifle
* Unified ammo system
* Animated menu
* Instructions
* Photo-gallery
* Strip Image Loading
* Sound Engine
* etc.

## Warning

This was my first large programming project in my undergraduate, so the code is a bit poorly written.

This repository is not in working condition as I am in the process of overhauling the game engine. Since it's quite a large project, I am unsure if it will even be in a working state again.
